# WhatsApp MCP Server (Community Fork)

> **Why this fork?** The [upstream repo](https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp) has been frozen since early 2025 — over 30 open PRs with critical fixes (broken whatsmeow API, LID contact migration, security hardening) were left unmerged. This fork cherry-picks the best of those PRs and keeps the bridge working against current WhatsApp protocol.

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for WhatsApp.

With this you can search and read your personal WhatsApp messages (including images, videos, documents, and audio messages), search your contacts and send messages to either individuals or groups. You can also create and leave groups.

It connects to your **personal WhatsApp account** directly via the WhatsApp web multidevice API (using the [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) library). All your messages are stored locally in a SQLite database and only sent to an LLM (such as Claude) when the agent accesses them through tools (which you control).

> *Caution:* as with many MCP servers, the WhatsApp MCP is subject to [the lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/). Prompt injection could lead to private data exfiltration.

## What's new in this fork

### Bug fixes & compatibility
- **whatsmeow API updated** — the upstream bridge broke when whatsmeow added `context.Context` to all API calls. Fixed across all call sites.
- **PNG QR fallback** — QR code is saved to `/tmp/whatsapp-qr.png` and opened automatically on macOS if the terminal rendering is hard to scan.

### Security
- **REST API bound to `127.0.0.1` by default** — the upstream bound to `0.0.0.0`, meaning anyone on the same LAN could send messages as you. Set `BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0` to opt back into LAN exposure.

### Contact name resolution (LID migration)
WhatsApp has been migrating contacts from phone-based JIDs (`+55...@s.whatsapp.net`) to internal LID JIDs (`xxx@lid`) for privacy. This broke contact search, `get_direct_chat_by_contact`, and `list_messages` in the upstream. Fixed with:
- `_resolve_phone_to_jids` — looks up all JID variants (PN + LID) for a phone number via `whatsapp.db`
- `search_contacts` now searches `whatsmeow_contacts` in `whatsapp.db` first (real names + LID contacts), falling back to `messages.db`
- `get_direct_chat_by_contact` resolves LID JIDs to phone numbers correctly
- `resolveToPN` in the Go bridge normalizes LID→PN at write time so the same contact never splits across two `chat_jid` values
- `migrateLIDChats` runs at startup and merges any existing `@lid` chat rows into their `@s.whatsapp.net` equivalents (transactional, idempotent)

### Contact name display
- New `senders` table in `messages.db` stores `full_name`, `push_name`, `business_name` per sender
- `SyncAllContacts` bulk-upserts the whatsmeow contact store into `senders` on connect and after each history sync
- Incoming messages enrich `senders` with `PushName` + contact store data
- Terminal log now shows human-readable names instead of raw phone numbers
- `GetChatName` checks the local `senders` table before hitting the live contact store

### Outbound message persistence
- Sent text messages are stored locally immediately so your own sends appear in the conversation history without waiting for a multi-device echo (which doesn't fire on single-device accounts)

### Media improvements
- Document uploads now use stdlib MIME detection instead of hardcoding `application/octet-stream`
- `FileName` field set on `DocumentMessage` so files display correctly in WhatsApp

### Group management (new MCP tools)
- **`create_group`** — create a new WhatsApp group with a name and participants; optionally create as a community parent or sub-group
- **`leave_group`** — leave a group by JID

### Configuration
- `WHATSAPP_BRIDGE_PORT` env var — change the REST API port (default `8080`)
- `WHATSAPP_API_BASE_URL` env var — point the Python MCP server at a non-default bridge URL
- `BIND_ADDR` env var — change the bind address of the REST API

## Installation

### One-line install (macOS / Linux / WSL)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodrigopg/whatsapp-mcp/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script:
- checks Go 1.21+, Python 3.9+, uv (installs uv if missing)
- clones the repo to `~/.whatsapp-mcp`
- compiles the Go bridge
- writes `claude_desktop_config.json` / `~/.cursor/mcp.json` automatically
- creates a `start-bridge.sh` launcher
- on macOS: writes a launchd plist for optional auto-start

After install, run `~/.whatsapp-mcp/start-bridge.sh`, open **http://localhost:8080/qr** in your browser, scan the QR, then restart Claude Desktop or Cursor.

---

### Manual install

#### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Python 3.9+
- Claude Desktop (or Cursor)
- UV: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- FFmpeg *(optional)* — auto-converts audio to Opus for voice messages

#### Steps

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rodrigopg/whatsapp-mcp.git
   cd whatsapp-mcp
   ```

2. **Run the WhatsApp bridge**

   ```bash
   cd whatsapp-bridge
   go run main.go
   ```

   On first run, open **http://localhost:8080/qr** in your browser and scan the QR code with WhatsApp (Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device). The page auto-refreshes when a new code is generated. On macOS the QR is also saved to `/tmp/whatsapp-qr.png` and opened in Preview.

3. **Connect to the MCP server**

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "whatsapp": {
         "command": "{{PATH_TO_UV}}",
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-mcp-server",
           "run",
           "main.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   - **Claude Desktop**: save as `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Cursor**: save as `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

4. **Restart Claude Desktop / Cursor**

### Windows

`go-sqlite3` requires CGO. Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), add `ucrt64\bin` to `PATH`, then:

```bash
cd whatsapp-bridge
go env -w CGO_ENABLED=1
go run main.go
```

## Architecture

```
Claude / Cursor
      ↕ MCP (stdio)
Python MCP Server  (whatsapp-mcp-server/)
      ↕ HTTP REST
Go WhatsApp Bridge (whatsapp-bridge/)
      ↕ WhatsApp Web protocol
   WhatsApp servers
```

**Storage** (`whatsapp-bridge/store/`):
- `messages.db` — chats, messages, senders (local SQLite, written by the bridge)
- `whatsapp.db` — whatsmeow session + contact store (written by whatsmeow)

## Troubleshooting

- **QR code not displaying**: terminal QR not working? Check `/tmp/whatsapp-qr.png` (macOS opens it automatically).
- **Contacts showing as numbers**: the bridge syncs names on connect. Give it a few seconds after the "Connected" message.
- **LID contacts not found**: happens when WhatsApp hasn't yet synced the LID→PN mapping locally. Reconnect to trigger a fresh sync.
- **Out of sync**: delete `whatsapp-bridge/store/messages.db` and `whatsapp-bridge/store/whatsapp.db`, restart to re-authenticate.
- **Device limit**: WhatsApp limits linked devices. Remove one via Settings → Linked Devices on your phone.
